    content:
      "In the professional kitchen, Himalayan salt is prized for its 'mild' saltiness and high heat resistance. Using a salt block for searing scallops or steaks adds a subtle, complex saltiness that you simply cannot get from a shaker. When seasoning, chefs prefer the coarse grind to control the 'pop' of flavor. It's particularly effective for finishing chocolates or caramels, where the pink hue provides a beautiful visual contrast.",

      "Deep beneath the Himalayan foothills lies the Khewra Salt Mine, the second largest in the world. Mining here isn't just an industry; it's a heritage. Using the 'Room and Pillar' method, miners harvest the salt while leaving large pillars of salt to support the structure of the mine. This ensures that the earth remains stable. The salt is hand-mined to preserve its crystalline structure and mineral content, ensuring that no heavy explosives or harsh chemicals contaminate the 'Pink Gold' before it reaches your table.",

      "To create the ultimate detox bath, dissolve 1-2 cups of coarse Himalayan salt in warm water. Unlike regular sea salt, the high mineral content of pink salt helps to draw out toxins through a process called reverse osmosis. For a 'Sleep Well' soak, add 5 drops of lavender essential oil and a tablespoon of coconut oil. Soak for at least 20 minutes to allow your skin to absorb the magnesium and potassium, leaving you relaxed and your skin incredibly soft.",
